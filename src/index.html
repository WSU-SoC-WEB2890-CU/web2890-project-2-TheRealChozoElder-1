        <p>Beach Haven is the name of a small town in eastern Pennsylvania. It’s on the bank of the Susquehanna River.
            The
            town was founded by Nathan Beach who purchased the property from descendents of William Penn in the late
            1700s.
            Though few of us live in the actual Beach Haven, we can all strive to make our individual circumstances a
            haven
            of sorts. A good way to help in that process is to stay connected with each other. This idea was the
            inspiration
            of the Beach Haven Press (BHP) that began in 1994. It is also the inspiration for this web site.</p>
